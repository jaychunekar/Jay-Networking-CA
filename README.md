# Automated Dockerized Web Application Deployment

This project demonstrates the automation of a Dockerized web application deployment using modern DevOps tools. The workflow includes provisioning cloud infrastructure, configuring servers, containerizing the application, and implementing a CI/CD pipeline using **Terraform**, **Docker**, **SSH**, and **GitHub Actions**.

---

## **Project Overview**

The project automates the deployment of a sample web application hosted on an **Nginx** server. The application is containerized using **Docker** and deployed on an **Amazon Web Services(VM)**. The infrastructure is provisioned using **Terraform**, and the CI/CD pipeline is implemented using **GitHub Actions**.

---

## **Features**

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform scripts automate the provisioning of AWS (VM, network, security groups).
- **Docker Containerization**: The application is packaged into a Docker container for portability and consistency.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions automates the build, test, and deployment process.
- **SSH Configuration**: Manual server configuration ensures Docker is installed and ready for deployment.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Terraform**: For provisioning Azure infrastructure.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the web application.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the CI/CD pipeline.
- **AWS**: For hosting the virtual machine and application.
- **SSH**: For server configuration and deployment.
